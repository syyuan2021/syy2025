This blog mainly record my learning process of LLM decoding or text generation approach including beam search, top-k, top-q, speculate-decoding.

# 1. Why we need decoding?

## 1.1 Decoding Issue
Decoding method optimization has two main goals: efficient inference (faster decoding) and effective semantic (accurate decoding).


## 1.2 Current Decoding Methods

# 2. Beam Search Decoding

# 3. Top-K 

# 4. Top-Q

# 5. Speculate Decoding
Speculate decoding [1]
