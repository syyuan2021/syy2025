This blog mainly record my learning process of deepseek reasoning model: DeepSeek-R1-Zero and DeepSeek-R1. 

# 0 Main Objective 
Reasoning 

# 1. DeepSeek-R1-Zero
RL without SFT.

## 1.1 Main Objective 


## 1.2 Model Architecture 

# 2. DeepSeek-R1
incorporates multi-stage training and cold-start data before RL

## 2.1 Main Objective 

### 2.1.1 Reinforcement Learning with Cold Start
#### 2.1.1.1 What is Cold Start
Construct and collect a small amount of long CoT data to fine-tune the model as the initial RL actor.



## 2.2 Model Architecture
